## Software development process

### lifecycle overview; major stages & roles

Given below are the various phases of SDLC:

- Requirement gathering and analysis
- Design
- Implementation or coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

### iterative development

Iterative development is a way of breaking down the software development of a large application into smaller chunks. In iterative development,  feature code is designed, developed and tested in repeated cycles. With each iteration, additional features can be designed, developed and tested until there is a fully functional software application ready to be deployed to customers.

The purpose of working iteratively is to allow more flexibility for changes. By working iteratively, the project team goes through a cycle where they evaluate with each iteration, and determine what changes are needed to produce a satisfactory end product.

### backlog

The development backlog defines what work will be performed by the design and development team.

**User Story**

### issue tracking system
### programming style standards
### CI concepts

## Estimations

### estimations concepts

## Scrum/Agile

### agile development methodologies

One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In the waterfall model, there is always a separate testing phase after a build phase; however, in agile software development testing is completed in the same iteration as programming.

Another difference is that traditional "waterfall" software development moves a project through various Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) phases. One phase is completed in its entirety before moving on to the next phase.
