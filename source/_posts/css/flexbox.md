  display: flex;
}
```

The flex container properties are:

- flex-direction
  - row
  - row-reverse
  - column
  - column-reverse
- flex-wrap
  - nowrap
  - wrap
  - wrap-reverse

- flex-flow

The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for: flex-direction, flex-wrap

- order

The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order.

- justify-content
- align-items
- align-content
