HTML Root Tags represent the main or the starting tag that should be present in all the HTML documents. The HTML tag is the first tag that comes after the <!DOCTYPE> tag and within which other HTML tags are specified. This tag allows the browser to identify the document type.

## Definition and Usage

The `<html>` tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The `<html>` tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag).
