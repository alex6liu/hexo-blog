## operators

`i++` 优先级高于 `++i`

## loops

### differences

- A `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations the loop needs to make. 
- A `while` loop can be used when you need your loop to run an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met. 
- `for/in` - loops through the properties of an object. `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true. `do/while` - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true.

## skip loops

- The `break` statement "jumps out" of a loop.

- The `continue` statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
