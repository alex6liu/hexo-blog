These six types are considered to be primitives. A primitive is not an object and has no methods of its own. All primitives are immutable.

- Boolean — true or false
- Null — no value
- Undefined — a declared variable but hasn’t been given a value
- Number — integers, floats, etc
- String — an array of characters i.e words
- Symbol — a unique value that's not equal to any other value

Everything else is an Object type.
