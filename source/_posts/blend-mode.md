The `<blend-mode>` CSS data type describes how colors should appear when elements overlap. It is used in the background-blend-mode and mix-blend-mode properties.

For each pixel among the layers to which it is applied, a blend mode takes the colors of the foreground and the background, perfoms a calculation on them, and returns a new color value.
